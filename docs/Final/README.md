### Summary
This is a first pass attempt to understand the conditions underpinning the global innovation economy from 2007-2017. We look at several factors such as Intellectual Property filings, entrepreneurship and creativity indexes as well as other factors. At the moment, there is no interactivity -- but will be updated with interactive features around geography in future iterations. 

* A sample of what visualizations might look like:

* With integration of a map and narrative quality using "Scrollytelling":

### Final Goals
My goal is to integrate these initial sketches into a Vue.js application to create an interactive experience for desktop and mobile, where the user will be able to explore data related to decades of intellectual property and creative economy information between different countries. 

* In this Raw_Sketch folder, everything is contained with in a single index.html file. 
* [Scrollama.js](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) are implemented in this first iteration.
