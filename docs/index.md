### [Project 1 - Quantitative Visualization](https://leeallennyc.github.io/Major-Studio-1/Project01/)
---
### Summary:
For this quantitative visualization project we are looking at the [Smithsonian's archive](https://www.si.edu/openaccess) and [API](http://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/) through [Open Access Collections](https://collections.si.edu/search/).

The purpose of the project is to quantitatively represent data using information from the Smithsonian.

I've chosen a specific object from the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History called a [Color Guide](https://www.si.edu/object/color-guide-artificial-eye-prosthesis:nmah_1119630), which was used a tool for matching the color of the eye when making prosthetic eyes.

I've chosen to look across various collections at the Smithsonian to better understand the "Eyes of the Smithsonian".

### Summary:
For this interactive visualization project we are looking at the [Smithsonian's archive](https://www.si.edu/openaccess) and [API](http://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/) through [Open Access Collections](https://collections.si.edu/search/).

The purpose of the project is to create an interactive visualization from data coming from The Smithsonian.

I've chosen to look across various collections at the Smithsonian to better understand the "Eyes of the Smithsonian".
